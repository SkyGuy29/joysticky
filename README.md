This is my first rhythm game idea that actually seemed to work. The initial idea actually came from how I listened to music.
When I'm on my own, I will typically move my head or upper body along with the rhythm.
It wasn't until more recently when a producer friend of mine with a large passion for music showed me how he moved to stuff.
He's actually a good dancer, but what stuck out to me more was the rhythmic hand movements he did, sort of like conducting but more expressionate.
I took inspiration from this and started doing similar things on my own, adapting it to what I enjoyed as well.
I developed what i now call "hand dancing" which is basically just my hand on my thigh in a spider position moving around like crazy to the song.
A while later, I realized that this was a lot like moving around a joystick, just without grabbing onto aything. The movements were pretty one to one though,
and that's when the idea hit me. A hand dancing rhythm game with a joystick, moving around and hitting notes in a circle.
As I let the idea simmer a little, it seemed more and more feasible. It was simple enough, but still brilliantly unique and rich.
Now here we are. The very beginning, idea still just as bright as before. Let's hope I can make it a reality.
